## Short Biography of Daniil Ternovskyi by Daniil Ternovskyi

### Personal part

Hi! My name is **Daniil Ternovskyi** and I am an LBS MFA 2022 student. I am originally from Ukraine, from Odesa, a city on the shore of the Black Sea. Although I am originally from there, I have lived in a number of countries:

1. *USA* (for studying at Penn State, where I majored in Finance, with minors in Economics and Spanish)
2. *UK* (for interning at JPM in summer 2019, but also, now, for LBS)
3. *Canada* (during my pre-university studies at the University of Toronto)
4. *Chile* (during my internship in OCEX Peru in Chile in 2017)
5. *Spain* (during my study abroad in Barcelona in summer 2016)

All my international experience led me to lots of interesting extracurricular, such as volunteering in Fray Lazaro, a tiny community in southern Honduras, for example. Overall, I consider myself a great explorer of new cultures and traditions, being open to diversity and change in life.

### Professional part

As for my professional career, I would firstly refer you to a quick snapshot of me in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniil-ternovskyi/), where you can find a short overview of my past experience and in what I am interested in. In general, I am keen on working with people and helping them, so I am very interested in Private Wealth Management, as this field would allow me to travel, work with diverse clients, and establish long-lasting relationships with interesting people. 

I hope that you enjoyed reading this, and I wish you the very best of your day.
