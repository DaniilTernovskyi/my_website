In my free time, I share a wide range of hobbies and interests. My biggest one is traveling, and by the age of 23, I was fortunate enough to visit 46 countries at 6 continents and live for an extended period (2 months+) in 5 of them (USA, Canada, UK, Spain, Chile). I admire the opportunity to travel alone and get to know local people, and keep in touch with the vast network of friends who I met during those travels. I am also interested in various sports: football, hiking, skiing, scuba-diving, chess. As for football, I have been a semi-professional player during my school and undergraduate studies and have been a great fan of worldwide football (tactics, coaches, players). I am also a professional football kits collector and have a collection of more than 50 kits worldwide and more than 75 scarfs from football clubs and nations. As for skiing, I have been training since I was five years old, and every year since then, I traveled to Europe to ski in the Alps. As for scuba-diving, I hold PADI Open Water Diver certification and have done more than 15 dives in the Red Sea, Great Barrier Reef, and Black Sea. As for hiking, I am particularly keen on mountain hiking, and my highest mountain so far is mount Giluwe in Papua New Guinea (4,367 meters). As for other interests, I am interested in reading, mostly adventure literature, and professional finance books. I have recently tried to read original pieces as much as I can in Spanish to enrich my vocabulary and speech. I am also interested in volunteering and have been engaged in various volunteering opportunities during my high school and undergraduate degree.
